For this iteration of the technical documentation:

Each team member will have a separate tech doc that they can edit, organize, and write down
anything they want.

The official tech doc 'GE02_official_technical_documentation' will only include relevant 
documentation from each member with matching formatting. This document will be the document
submitted to canvas.

The file 'technical_documentation_format' will be for format suggestions or any changes that
should be made to the official document i.e. different font, layout change, font size change,
main and subsystem changes. As well as suggestions or notes on the current documentation 
system.
